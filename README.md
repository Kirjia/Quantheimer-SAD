# Std/Quantum data analysis for Alzheimer disease (Quantheimer)
## Project overview
Quantheimer is a project that aims to find new evidence on the alzheimer desiease, using standard data analysis and quantum approach.
## Targets
This project has the goal to answer three reserach question.
- **RQ 1: Is there a significant correlation between a diagnosis of depression and a positive diagnosis of dementia?**
- **RQ 2: Is it possible to identify alternative or unconventional patterns that are useful for early diagnosis?**
- **RQ 3: What differences emerge from comparing the
results obtained using traditional clustering techniques
and those derived from quantum clustering algorithms?**
## Resources
All the resources needed to replicate the project are on this repository.
## Dataset
The dataset is taken from a [polish study on alzheimer](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004796/versions/1.1.0).
The sample has 192 entries each of those provides features about gene's risk, psychometric (memory, intelligence, mood, personality, stress coping strategies), basic demographic and health data.
A subset of this dataset (79 samples) provide the blood test.
